# 2294. Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-such-that-maximum-difference-is-k/description/)

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,6,1,2,5], k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can partition nums into the two subsequences [3,1,2] and [6,5].

The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequence is 3 - 1 = 2.

The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequence is 6 - 5 = 1.

Since two subsequences were created, we return 2. It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of subsequences needed.

```java
class Solution {
    public int partitionArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        //greedy sliding window
        int res = 0;
        int left = 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i]-nums[left]>k) {
                left = i;
                res++;
            }
        }
        //1, 2,| 3
        //      left
        //1, 2,| 3  4
        //       left
        //1, 2,| 3  | 5
        //           left
        
        return res+1;
    }
}
